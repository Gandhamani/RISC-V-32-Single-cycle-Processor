# RISC-V-32-Single-cycle-Processor
The RISC-V 32-bit single-cycle processor is a fundamental and straightforward implementation of the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA), tailored to execute one complete instruction per clock cycle. This design is pivotal in understanding the essential components and functioning of a processor.
